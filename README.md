This repository includes the model and databases for YOLOv9-based face detection. The model works well for challenging visual environments, such as varying illuminations, inside vehicles, etc. 

The model was created using the Wider Face database. The Wider Face database is available at http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/ 

The database created under varying illumination conditions for our study are given under the "Dark Illumination Database-MSM" folder. This database contains images extracted from a video taken in a moving bus at night with different illumination.
The YOLOv9 model can be found in the "Models" folder.
